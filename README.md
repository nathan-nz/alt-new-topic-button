# Alternate New Topic Button
Adds an additional New Topic Button in each specified category, which directs to an alternative target for topic creation.

The use case is to allow the super easy posting of a topic into a more restricted subcategory from an open parent category.
While this is easy for savvy Discourse users, novice users don't really understand how subcategories work, nor how to post in one easily from the composer.
